   Loaded projects from ConstructBMS: 5 projects
   Loaded tasks from ConstructBMS: 8 tasks
   ```
3. **Navigate to the Asta PowerProject replica** using the top navigation
4. **You should now see**:
   - Projects in the sidebar
   - Tasks in the task grid
   - Gantt chart with timeline
   - All the Asta PowerProject replica features working

## ðŸŽ¯ What You'll See

Once the data is inserted, your ProjectPlanner will show:

- **8 tasks for the Office Building project** with proper dependencies
- **Real Gantt chart timeline** showing task relationships
- **Enhanced ProjectPlanner features** like priority tracking and hour estimates

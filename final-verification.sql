-- Final ProjectPlanner Integration Verification
-- Run this to confirm everything is working perfectly

-- =====================================================
-- 1. VERIFY ALL COMPONENTS
-- =====================================================

-- All tables exist
SELECT 'âœ… All Tables Created' as component, COUNT(*) as count

-- 2. VERIFY ENHANCED FEATURES
-- =====================================================

-- Enhanced fields working on projects

-- =====================================================
-- 3. VERIFY VIEWS AND AUTOMATION
-- =====================================================

-- Enhanced views working
SELECT 'âœ… Enhanced Views' as feature,
       (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM projectplanner_enhanced_projects) as enhanced_projects,
       (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM projectplanner_enhanced_tasks) as enhanced_tasks;

-- =====================================================
-- 4. VERIFY SECURITY
-- =====================================================
